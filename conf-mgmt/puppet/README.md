Puppet and AWS CodeDeploy
-----------------------

[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) is a configuration management system that allows you to define the
state of your IT infrastructure, then automatically enforces the correct state. AWS provides a
couple of sample templates to get you working with Puppet and AWS CodeDeploy faster. The first is a
Puppet module that will install and start the AWS CodeDeploy host agent, giving you the ability to
continue managing your host infrastructure via Puppet while also being able to take advantage of the
power of AWS CodeDeploy. The second sample template demonstrates how to use CodeDeploy to
orchestrate running modules and manifests via masterless puppet on each node.
