Ansible and AWS CodeDeploy
--------------------------

[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your
applications and systems easier to deploy. If you already have a set of Ansible playbooks, but just
need somewhere to run them, our first template for Ansible and AWS CodeDeploy will demonstrate how a
couple of simple deployment hooks will ensure Ansible is available on the local deployment instance
and run the given playbooks.  Alternatively, if you already have a process for building and
maintaining your inventory, we've also built an Ansible module that you can use to install and run
the AWS CodeDeploy host agent.
