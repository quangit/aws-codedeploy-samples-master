SaltStack and AWS CodeDeploy
----------------------------

[Salt](http://www.saltstack.com) is a fast, scalable and flexible systems management software for
data center automation, cloud orchestration, server provisioning, configuration management and more.
The two sample templates AWS provides offer examples for how you can integrate existing Salt
infrastructure with AWS CodeDeploy. On the one hand, you can use the AWS CodeDeploy module to
install and run the CodeDeploy host agent on your minions. On the other hand, you can use AWS
CodeDeploy via a couple of simple deployment hooks to orchestrate running your Salt States. Either
way, you get to take advantage of the power of both Salt and AWS CodeDeploy.
